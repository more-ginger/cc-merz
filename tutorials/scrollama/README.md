# D3.js Line Chart with Scrollama Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through creating a line chart using D3.js library and integrating it with Scrollama for scroll-based interactions. We will go step by step, assuming you have little experience in coding.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with D3.js library and Scrollama library.

## Setup

1. Create a new HTML file and save it as `index.html`.
2. Set up the basic structure of the HTML file.
3. Create the necessary CSS styles in a separate file called `styles.css`.
4. Link the CSS file to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.
5. Create a new JavaScript file called `script.js`.
6. Import the D3.js and Scrollama libraries in the `script.js` file.

## HTML Structure

Start by setting up the HTML structure. We will have two main containers: `article` for the steps and `visualization` for the line chart.

```html
<body>
  <div id="article">
    <!-- Steps will be added here -->
  </div>

  <div id="visualization">
    <!-- Line chart will be added here -->
  </div>

  <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
